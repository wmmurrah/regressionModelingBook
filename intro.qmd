## A little philosophy of science

To me, reality consists of all that exists.
This includes, physical objects and processes as well as things like ideas, feeling, and beliefs.
So, to me, reality is unitary by definition -- there is one reality.
But it is extremely complicated.
I suspect that it is so complicated that we may never be able to fully comprehend it all, as a species, much less any one of us.

Does this mean we can understand reality at all?
I don't think so.
I don't fully understand how my car works, but I do have basic ideas that allow me to problem solve issues such as when it won't start.
When we can't fully understand something, we are left to build an model of that process.
I will talk more about models below, but for now think of a model as an oversimplified representation of a much more complex system.

## Modeling in Science

### Modeling Workflow (McElreath, 2023)

1.  Define a generative model of the sample,
2.  Define specific estimand,
3.  Define statistical model to produce estimand,
4.  Test statistical model (3) using generative model (1),
5.  Analyze and summarize sample.

## Research Design and Analysis

### Exploratory to Confirmatory Data Analysis Continuum

see[@Fife2022Understandingexploratory/confirmatorydata]

A p-value cannot be used for exploratory analyses.

If your theoretical framework does not suggest a causal graph, you are very likely not ready for a confirmatory data analysis.
